# Board_Games
In this project, I build three games that can be played in the console using python. 

# Main_file
This file contains the main menu and is the main file for the game modules. The user can choose which game they want to play. All games are played in the terminal. The games included are Tic Tac Toe, Number Guessing Game, and Rock, Paper, Scissors. 

# Game Logs
There are functions in the game_log_writer file that can create/clear game logs and to collect the results from each game. More funcitons will be added to gather more data from these games along with more features for the games.
